- Remove all lists which doesn't have a task
- Tell user to add their first task when there's no task
- Save button shows up after a task is checked, not always
- Add drag and drop
- Removing a task should tell user that are they sure? 
because the task might have not been saved on the archives
and progress will be lost. 
- Tell user when saving that all unchecked tasks will be
considered as undone which means red, are you sure you 
want to continue?
